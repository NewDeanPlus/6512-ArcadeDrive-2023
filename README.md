## Team 6512 Arcade Drive Code
This is the code we used for our robot from the 2023 season. Looking back, this code was *ridiculously* basic compared to whatever the heck we're trying to do now.
Our robot this year, [as seen on our website](https://coastalcatastrophe6512.weebly.com/history.html), consisted mainly of an elevator and pneumatic claw that was able to pick up both cones and cubes.
This code also has both Tank and Arcade drive files, as we had issues with driving straight and kept playing around with the drive trains as a result. The issue ended up being a mechanical problem.

### Functions
- Elevator that worked thanks to some constant force springs and some simple code
- Arm and claw that worked to both pick up and place both cones and cubes pretty consistently

### Cool Stuff We Learned & Figured Out
- I was pretty proud of the EfficientArm class, which simplifies the countless elevator, claw, and arm movements into commands that could be executed and understood quickly and efficiently by the drivers
- Locking wheels can be pretty helpful when you need a motor to stop moving, although it didn't help with balancing as much as I thought it would due to the robot's weight
